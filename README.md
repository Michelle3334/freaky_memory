## Surface
### Colors
The main colors used in this project:
* Background color: Granny apple #C3F8CE
* Font color: Seal brown #191515
* Link & hover color: Blue Marguerite #6C57B7
    * Initially I was going to use Bilboa green #317213 for the link and hover text, but during initial development I realised the color contrast was not great enough.
