## Surface
### Colors
The main colors used in this project:
* Header background color: Granny apple #C3F8CE
* Background color: Granny apple #D5F6DC
* Font color: Seal brown #191515
* Link & hover color: Blue Marguerite #6C57B7
    * Initially I was going to use Bilboa green #317213 for the link and hover text, but during initial development I realised the color contrast was not great enough.

# Testing
## Functionality Testing
* I used Google Chrome developer tools throughout the development process for testing and solving problems with style issues.
* All links were tested multiple times during the development process to ensure that all pages were linked correctly.
* Family members were asked to view the site and point out any bugs.

## Code Validation
* The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. Beautifytools was used to validate the JavaScript code.
